# DotNetMap
.NET class library for dealing with mapping/geospatial data.

It is possible to create interactive graphical maps in many front end frameworks such as Bing Maps (Silverlight/JavaScript), Google Maps (JavaScript) and Leaflet/MapBox (JavaScript).

The client side implementations vary, but there are common themes especially from a server side point of view.

There are a lot of concepts that be represented in re-usable C# code.  For this reason, I have created a class library of ".NET Mapping" objects and helpers, which represent the mapping concepts such as geographical points, bounding boxes, proximities, distance calculation and zoom level calculation.
